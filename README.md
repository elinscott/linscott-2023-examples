Supporting files for Linscott et al. (2023)
===========================================
Description
-------
This archive contains files that accompany the article "``koopmans``: an open-source package for accurately and efficiently predicting spectral properties with Koopmans spectral functionals" (Linscott et al., 2023).

Contents
--------
There are three examples: ozone, bulk silicon, and bulk zinc oxide, each with their own directory. Each directory contains...
- an ``koopmans`` input file (``.json``)
- an output file (``.log``) generated by running the input file
- various other files generated by the above calculation (such as ``Quantum ESPRESSO`` input and output files)

Reproducing the results
-----------------------
Provided that the ``koopmans`` package is installed, the calculations can be rerun either...
- by running ``koopmans <seed>.json`` in the appropriate directory, or
- by running the script ``run_all.py``.
